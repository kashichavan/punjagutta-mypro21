How to create our first django-application inside the project
--------------------------------------------------------------
step 1) activate a vir environment

step 2) go to main folder and create a project

step 3) in projector container create an application


step 4) application is created by using command 

	python manage.py startapp appName[myapp]

step 5) one new older will be created inside the project container.

Describe about files present in app:
----------------------------------------
__init__.py:
---------------
It is initialization file. It is blank python script file. Python treated this file as a package.

Admin.py:
--------------------
In this file contains the code which is reasonable for giving the feature to the admin. If ever we want to give any access to the admin the code with respect to that will be written in admin.py

App.py:
-----------------
It is file containing the configuration of an APP

Models.py:
--------------
It is the database related file was we write our code to create a table inside the 
database.

Test.py:
------------
It is file that contains the test cases (unit test cases) that are written to automate the project.

Views.py:
-----------------
It is file containing the functions (or) the classes that are reasonable for views 
operations rendering the response to the front end.

step 5: 
open views.py inside the application and create your own views

from django.shortcuts import render
from django.http import HttpResponse

# Create your views here.
def home(request):
    return HttpResponse("<h1 style='color : red'>This is Home page</h1>")


step 6:
after creating own views, all the views need to be registered with url
so we need to open urls.py from the project directory.



step 7:
create your own urls with connecting with views

from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path
from myapp.views import home

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('home/',home)

step 8: run the server
